# Side Project Inspiration
* React project to get inspired by seeing other awesome side projects
* Part of my react learning journey
* My attempt to dive deep into api calls navigating through the docs and asynchronous javscript

## Learnings
* Learned to navigate through the docs
* Learned when to use asynchronous javascript and when not to use
* Learned to make projects with time limits
* Learned to convert class based components efficiently to function based components
